Recap and Next Steps
1. Refactor the run() method
Extract frame parsing logic into a dedicated FrameParser class.
Keep run() focused on just reading bytes and dispatching complete frames.

2. Policy-based approach
Use policy classes for platform-dependent functionality:
MutexPolicy: Wraps mutex/locking (e.g., std::mutex or FreeRTOS semaphore).
QueuePolicy: For command/response queues (e.g., std::queue + std::condition_variable or FreeRTOS queue).
(Optional) ThreadPolicy: For launching/controlling threads/tasks if needed.
This keeps your code portable and easy to extend/test.

3. Transition uart_ctrl
Move away from a pure concept to a policy-based design, or use a hybrid (concept to enforce interface + policy for platform details).
This gives you more flexibility for adding behaviors (mutex, queue, etc.) without bloating the UART abstraction.

4. Blocking command handling
Each command method (e.g., get_config()) sends a command and blocks until its response is received.
Use a queue or similar primitive (not necessarily std::promise, given embedded constraints) to match responses to requests.
Status frames are handled separately, ideally via a callback or event mechanism.

5. Stay Embedded-Friendly
Minimize dynamic allocation.
Avoid heavy STL features if memory/CPU is tight.
Test with your target (ESP32/FreeRTOS) to ensure performance and reliability.


Actionable Steps:
- Define policies for mutex and queues for both STL and FreeRTOS.
- Refactor your sensor class to accept these policies as template parameters.
- Implement a FrameParser class for protocol/state machine handling.
- Rework command/response logic using queues or other lightweight primitives.
- Document the design for future maintainability and clarity.
